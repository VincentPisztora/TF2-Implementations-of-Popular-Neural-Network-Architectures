# TF2-Implementations-of-Popular-Neural-Network-Architectures

This repository contains code implementing a few commonly used neural network architectures as subclassed tensorflow 2 keras models. Available models:
1. ResNet18 ([Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385))
2. WideResNet ([Wide Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146))
3. ViT ([An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929/100))
4. ViT-MAE ([Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06377))
